<p> The General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon is an American single-engine supersonic multirole fighter aircraft originally
developed by General Dynamics for the United States Air Force (USAF). Designed as an air superiority day fighter, it
evolved into a successful all-weather multirole aircraft with over 4,600 built since 1976.[4] Although no longer
purchased by the U.S. Air Force, improved versions are being built for export. In 1993, General Dynamics sold its
aircraft manufacturing business to the Lockheed Corporation,[5] which became part of Lockheed Martin after a 1995 merger
with Martin Marietta.[6]

The F-16's key features include a frameless bubble canopy for enhanced cockpit visibility, a side-mounted control stick
to ease control while maneuvering, an ejection seat reclined 30 degrees from vertical to reduce the effect of g-forces
on the pilot, and the first use of a relaxed static stability/fly-by-wire flight control system that helps to make it an
agile aircraft. The fighter has a single turbofan engine, an internal M61 Vulcan cannon and 11 hardpoints. Although
officially named "Fighting Falcon", the aircraft is commonly known by the nickname "Viper".In addition to active duty in the U.S. Air Force, Air Force Reserve Command, and Air National Guard units, the aircraft
is also used by the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds aerial demonstration team, the US Air Combat Command F-16 Viper
Demonstration Team,[8] and as an adversary/aggressor aircraft by the United States Navy. The F-16 has also been procured
by the air forces of 25 other nations.[9] As of 2024, it is the world's most common fixed-wing aircraft in military
service, with 2,145 F-16s operational.[10]The F-16 is being used by the active-duty USAF, Air Force Reserve, and Air National Guard units, the USAF aerial
demonstration team, the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds, and as an adversary-aggressor aircraft by the United States Navy at
the Naval Strike and Air Warfare Center.[citation needed]

The U.S. Air Force, including the Air Force Reserve and the Air National Guard, flew the F-16 in combat during Operation
Desert Storm in 1991 and in the Balkans later in the 1990s. F-16s also patrolled the no-fly zones in Iraq during
Operations Northern Watch and Southern Watch and served during the War in Afghanistan and the War in Iraq from 2001 and
2003 respectively. In 2011, Air Force F-16s took part in the intervention in Libya.[106]

On 11 September 2001, two unarmed F-16s were launched in an attempt to ram and down United Airlines Flight 93 before it
reached Washington D.C. during the 11 September 2001 terrorist attacks, but Flight 93 was prematurely brought down by
the hijackers after passengers attacked the cockpit, so the F-16s were retasked to patrol the local airspace and later
escorted Air Force One back to Washington.[107][108][importance?]

The F-16 had been scheduled to remain in service with the U.S. Air Force until 2025.[109] Its replacement is planned to
be the F-35A variant of the Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II, which is expected to gradually begin replacing several
multirole aircraft among the program's member nations. However, owing to delays in the F-35 program, all USAF F-16s will
receive service life extension upgrades.[110] In 2022, it was announced the USAF would continue to operate the F-16 for
another two decades.[111]</p>
